# Oil Price Forecasting with Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs)
## Overview
Welcome to our repository for the Group Work Project 1 focused on forecasting crude oil prices using Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). This project is part of our coursework at WorldQuant University's MSc in Financial Engineering program.

## Project Description
In this project, we explore the application of PGMs to forecast crude oil prices, building upon the research conducted by Danish A. Alvi. Our objectives include understanding the suitability of Bayesian networks for this task and leveraging various economic, financial, and geopolitical data sources to enhance predictive accuracy.

## Project Steps
### 1. Problem Formulation
We define the problem addressed in Alvi's thesis, focusing on the challenges and advantages of using Bayesian networks in forecasting oil prices.

### 2. Data Collection
We sourced macroeconomic, microeconomic, and financial data from diverse repositories such as Yahoo Finance, FRED, and EIA. Each team member specialized in a specific dataset type to ensure comprehensive coverage.

### 3. Data Cleaning
We cleaned the collected data to remove outliers, address missing values, and ensure data integrity across all datasets. This step was crucial to prepare the data for modeling.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted to understand the distributional, time series, and multivariate characteristics of the data. This step provided insights into oil price behaviors and underlying trends.

### 5. Model Development
Each team member focused on different aspects of PGMs:

Student A: Defined probabilistic graphical models, distinguishing between belief networks and Markov networks.

Student B: Explored parameter learning techniques and their implications.

Student C: Investigated Markov chains and their application in causal modeling.

### 6. Algorithm Development
As a group, we developed pseudocode for Algorithm1: Inferred Causality, integrating concepts from our individual summaries on PGMs.
